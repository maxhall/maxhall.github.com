# Redesign of the site

## Components

Three post types:
* Project: title, date, content, tags
* Post: title, date, content, tags
* â€ŽLink: title, date, url and subtitle, tags


## Future modifications?
* Fancy url scheme where I can give a client a URL like
  * maxhall.github.io/design+code and it will display those on visiting
  * Good excuse to learn to handle the history api

## Todo

* Add some text to the body of the page when eveything is crossed out
* Look into new domain acquisition
* Check on the fancy link underlines
* Hover states for normal links and headlines on the front
* Fix alts on images
* Check that everything labelled open source has links to the code
* Sort out icons

## New model for the selector

- Based on menu selection compose a query
cycle through all the articles, and display only those that need to be there
