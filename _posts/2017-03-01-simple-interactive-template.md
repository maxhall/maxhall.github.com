[Interactive template](https://github.com/maxhall/interactive-template) â€“ A simple template to get you up and running developing responsive embedded elements. Uses Pym.js for responsive iframes, Rollup for bundling, Babel to transpile Javascript and Sass for better css. This project was designed to meet the needs of Honi Soit, borrowing inspiration form the Guardian's cool [interactive atom template](https://github.com/guardian/interactive-atom-template).
